Note Documentation


I recently came across a large roll of butcher paper, so I'm trying to do large notetaking in my studio and see how that affects my practice.

Lab visit

For my lab visit project, I went to the mycology lab on campus. It was an interesting experience, and the mycologist (one of the 2 at unm) seemed more interested in genetics and the model organism neospora crassa rather than mycology in general. Regardless, we had a good talk about fungi in regards to art and what citizen science means.

Project 1: Petri dish in the shape of an "e"
I wanted to 3d print a petri dish in the shape on an E for a project in my "Experiments in Cinema" class, but after it took a long time and I realized I was limited on time, it didn't seem practical to 3d print petri dishes to spell out the entire word "experiments" 

Anyways, it still turned out cool!

my name is rowan!

i love mushrooms and fashion and i just want to have fun on this mortal plane


i am currently writing an undergraduate thesis on making sustainable textiles out of mushrooms, based in fashion as a tool for self empowerment, and subverting ecologically and socially oppressive practices in the fashion industry. I believe that empowering yourself as an individual and working outside of capitalist structures we are beholden to in small ways can being to build the foundation of a better world. currently, however, this project is still in its early stages and i am in the process of learning to grow mushrooms and have not begun to develop textiles.
